AI-Art-Search
AI-Art-Search is a research project that aims to develop and test novel algorithms for web search and natural language processing using AI art. AI art is a form of generative art that uses artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and style transfer to create original and expressive artworks.

The main objectives of this project are:

To explore the potential of AI art as a source of rich and diverse data for web search and natural language processing tasks
To develop new methods and metrics for evaluating the quality, relevance, and diversity of AI art
To design and implement novel algorithms for query expansion, document ranking, summarization, question answering, and dialogue generation using AI art
To create a user-friendly interface and a web application that allows users to interact with the AI art search engine and generate their own artworks
Installation
To install the required dependencies for this project, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the AI art search engine, execute the following command:

python app.py

Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000/ to access the web application.

To generate your own AI art, use the following command:

python generate.py --style <style> --content <content> --output <output>

where <style> is the path to the style image, <content> is the path to the content image, and <output> is the path to the output image.
